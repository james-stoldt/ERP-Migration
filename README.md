# ERP Migration SQL Queries

### Overview

<p align="justify">
This repository contains some SQL queries I used to extract, transform, and load data from a legacy ERP system into a modern ERP platform, as well as some queries to build new tables based on the newly loaded data. There are also some utility queries I wrote, which I found useful - particularly in querying the DB2 catalog tables to identify tables which I needed.
